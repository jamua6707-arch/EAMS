# SYSTEM PROMPT — Smart Examination Attendance Management System (SEAMS)

> **Purpose of this document:** This is a self-contained technical and
> functional specification of the SEAMS codebase, written so that any AI
> coding agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cursor, etc.) can load it into context
> and immediately understand the system well enough to extend, debug, refactor,
> or reimplement it correctly — without needing to re-read every source file
> first. Paste this whole document as the first message/system prompt when
> asking an AI agent to work on this codebase.

## 1. What this system is

SEAMS replaces paper-based examination attendance sheets with a digital
workflow. An **Invigilator** looks up a student by Student ID (in place of
physically scanning an ID card), the system pulls that student's record from
what would be the university's official API (simulated here by a local
MongoDB collection seeded to look like an API response), automatically checks
whether the student is **eligible** to sit that specific exam (correct
faculty/department, correct exam, fees cleared if required), and records a
timestamped attendance entry. If the invigilator's device has no internet
connection, the scan is queued locally in the browser and is auto-synced to
the server the instant connectivity returns. Admins manage users, exams,
students, and view attendance reports.

This is a full implementation of a real academic project brief. It is not a
toy — it has real JWT auth, real role-based access control, a real duplicate-
prevention unique index, and a real offline queue.

## 2. Tech stack

| Layer      | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend  | React 18 (Vite), React Router v6, Tailwind CSS, Axios, lucide-react icons |
| Backend   | Node.js, Express 4 |
| Database  | MongoDB via Mongoose 8 |
| Auth      | JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken) + bcryptjs password hashing |
| Offline storage | Browser `localStorage` (frontend queue only — NOT used for auth tokens' security, just for queued attendance records) |

No TypeScript, no Redux, no server-side rendering — deliberately kept simple
and readable so any agent or junior developer can trace a request end to end.

## 4. Data model (MongoDB collections)

### User
```
fullName, username (unique), email (unique), password (hashed, select:false),
role: 'admin' | 'invigilator', isActive: Boolean, lastLogin: Date
```
Passwords are hashed with bcrypt in a `pre('save')` hook — controllers never
hash manually. `user.matchPassword(plain)` compares. `user.toSafeObject()`
strips the password before sending to the client.

### Examination
```
examName, courseCode, examDate, startTime, endTime, examRoom,
faculty, department, requireFeeCheck: Boolean,
status: 'scheduled' | 'ongoing' | 'completed' | 'cancelled',
assignedInvigilators: [User._id], createdBy: User._id
```

### Student (local cache of the "University API")
```
studentId (unique, uppercase), fullName, faculty, department,
feeStatus: 'Cleared' | 'Not Cleared', photoUrl, email
```
In a real deployment, `GET /api/students/lookup/:studentId` would call the
university's actual HTTPS API instead of querying this Mongo collection. The
controller (`studentController.lookupStudent`) is intentionally isolated so
swapping in a real HTTP call later only touches one function.

### AttendanceRecord
```
student: ObjectId ref Student, studentIdSnapshot: String,
exam: ObjectId ref Examination, invigilator: ObjectId ref User,
timeStamp: Date, syncStatus: 'Synced' | 'Pending',
eligibilityStatus: 'Eligible' | 'Not Eligible', eligibilityReason: String,
recordedOffline: Boolean
```
**`{ student: 1, exam: 1 }` has a unique compound index** — this is the actual
mechanism behind FR-12 (duplicate attendance prevention). Even if application
logic is bypassed, MongoDB itself rejects a second record for the same
student+exam pair (surfaced to the client as HTTP 409).

### SyncLog
```
attendanceRecord: ObjectId ref AttendanceRecord, syncTime: Date,
syncResult: 'Success' | 'Failed', message: String
```
Created every time a record is written or synced — an audit trail matching
the "SYNC_LOG" table in the original documentation.

## 5. Authentication & authorization flow

1. `POST /api/auth/login` with `{ username, password }` → verifies password →
   returns `{ token, user }`. Token payload: `{ id, role }`, expires per
   `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default 8h).
2. Frontend stores `token` and `user` in `localStorage` and attaches
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request via an axios request
   interceptor (`services/api.js`).
3. Backend `middleware/auth.js` → `protect` verifies the JWT, loads the user
   from Mongo, rejects if the account is deactivated (`isActive: false`).
4. `middleware/roleCheck.js` → `authorize('admin')` / `authorize('admin',
   'invigilator')` gates specific routes after `protect` has run.
5. Any `401` response anywhere triggers a global logout + redirect to
   `/login` (axios response interceptor).

**Role capabilities:**
- **Admin**: full CRUD on Users, Examinations, Students; views all Reports;
  can also do everything an Invigilator can.
- **Invigilator**: views exams assigned to them (`GET /api/exams?mine=true`),
  looks up students, records attendance, syncs offline records. Cannot manage
  users/students or view cross-exam reports.

## 6. Eligibility & attendance logic (the heart of the system)

`attendanceController.checkEligibility(student, exam)` is the single source
of truth, used by both the online path (`recordAttendance`) and the offline
sync path (`syncOfflineRecords`), so eligibility is always evaluated
server-side — never trusted from the client:

```js
1. student.faculty !== exam.faculty        → Not Eligible
2. student.department !== exam.department  → Not Eligible
3. exam.requireFeeCheck && feeStatus !== 'Cleared' → Not Eligible
4. otherwise                                → Eligible
```

Attendance is still **recorded** even when a student is Not Eligible (with
`eligibilityStatus: 'Not Eligible'` and a human-readable `eligibilityReason`)
so Admins have a full audit trail of rejected attempts, matching the
documentation's requirement to log eligibility failures for reporting.

### Online recording flow
`POST /api/attendance { studentId, examId }` →
find Student → find Exam → check for an existing AttendanceRecord (409 if
found) → run `checkEligibility` → create AttendanceRecord (`syncStatus:
'Synced'`) → create SyncLog → return populated record.

### Offline flow (frontend)
1. `AuthContext` tracks `navigator.onLine` via the browser's `online`/
   `offline` events, exposed as `isOnline`.
2. `ScanAttendance.jsx`: if `!isOnline`, the scan is pushed into
   `offlineQueue.addToQueue({ studentId, examId })` (localStorage), and the UI
   shows a `Pending` eligibility stamp with a note that it will sync later.
   It attempts an offline student lookup only for display purposes; the queue
   entry is kept regardless of whether that lookup succeeds.
3. The moment `isOnline` flips back to `true`, a `useEffect` in
   `ScanAttendance.jsx` calls `offlineQueue.syncQueue()`, which POSTs the
   whole queue to `POST /api/attendance/sync`.
4. `attendanceController.syncOfflineRecords` loops each queued item, re-runs
   the same `checkEligibility` logic server-side (never trusts a client-side
   eligibility guess), creates the AttendanceRecord with
   `recordedOffline: true`, and returns a per-item result array.
5. Frontend removes successfully-synced items from the local queue; anything
   that failed stays queued for the next sync attempt.

**Important:** offline eligibility is always finalized on the server during
sync — the client never marks something "Eligible" on its own authority.

## 7. Design system (frontend visual language)

The UI's visual identity is **Hormuud University's own brand** (primary green
`#138653`, deep green `#087443`, brand blue `#278FC5`, light background
`#F5F8FA`) layered on top of the original **"exam ledger / official seal"**
structural palette, which is still used for dark surfaces (sidebar, auth
screen) and neutral chrome.

- **Color tokens** (see `frontend/tailwind.config.js`): `ledger.*` (deep
  navy/ink, `ledger-950` `#0B1220` → `ledger-50` `#F7F8FB`) remains the
  structural palette for dark surfaces and neutral text/borders. `seal.*`
  (muted gold, `#B8862E`) is the older accent, still present but superseded
  by `brand.*` (Hormuud green/blue, see above) for CTAs, focus rings, active
  nav state, and the brand mark. Status colors stay semantic: `eligible`
  (now Hormuud primary green `#138653`), `ineligible` red, `pending` amber —
  preserve these three for any new UI, since they map directly to FR-15
  ("display attendance status... present, absent, pending sync").
- **Brand mark**: `components/HormuudLogo.jsx`, used in `AppLayout.jsx`'s
  sidebar and `Login.jsx`. It renders the real official crest, bundled as a
  Vite asset import from `frontend/src/assets/hormuud-logo.jpeg`, inside a
  small white rounded "chip" (the source JPEG has a solid white background
  and no transparency, so the chip is what makes it read correctly on the
  dark sidebar/login panel instead of sitting in a harsh white rectangle —
  it's visually a no-op on light surfaces). `object-fit: contain` preserves
  the crest's real (taller-than-wide) proportions. To replace the asset,
  swap that one file and the change propagates everywhere the component is
  used.
- **Shared UI primitives** (used across every Admin CRUD screen):
  `context/ToastContext.jsx` + `components/ToastViewport.jsx` (toast
  notifications — call `useToast().success/error/info(message)` from any
  page; the viewport is mounted once in `AppLayout.jsx`),
  `components/ConfirmDialog.jsx` (styled confirmation in place of
  `window.confirm()`, built on `Modal`), `components/TableSkeleton.jsx`
  (pulsing placeholder rows for a table body while its data is loading).
- **Typography**: `Inter` for both `font-display` (headings/brand) and
  `font-body` (UI text), per Hormuud's brand guide — the earlier serif
  `Newsreader` display face was replaced. `JetBrains Mono` (`font-mono`) is
  still used for Student IDs and timestamps.
- **Signature element**: `components/EligibilityStamp.jsx` — a circular,
  double-bordered "ink stamp" badge that animates onto the screen
  (`stamp-in` keyframe in `index.css`) the instant a scan resolves. Preserved
  as-is; it is a deliberate metaphor for the physical attendance-sheet
  stamp/signature this system digitizes, independent of the brand refresh.
- **Responsiveness**: sidebar navigation collapses to a fixed bottom nav bar
  below the `md` breakpoint (see `AppLayout.jsx`); all tables scroll
  horizontally on narrow viewports; forms in `Modal.jsx` stack to a single
  column.
- **Motion**: kept restrained — a stamp animation on eligibility results and
  a subtle fade-up on cards/lists; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables both.

If asked to redesign or restyle further, preserve the semantic status colors
and the stamp motif as above, and prefer extending `brand.*` tokens over
reintroducing `seal.*` for new UI.

## 8. Full API reference

Base URL: `/api`. All routes except `/auth/login` and `/health` require
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method & Path | Roles | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Public | Health check |
| `POST /auth/login` | Public | `{ username, password }` → `{ token, user }` |
| `GET /auth/me` | Any | Current user profile |
| `PUT /auth/change-password` | Any | `{ currentPassword, newPassword }` |
| `GET /users` | Admin | List all users |
| `GET /users/:id` | Admin | Single user |
| `POST /users` | Admin | Create user `{ fullName, username, email, password, role }` |
| `PUT /users/:id` | Admin | Update `{ fullName, email, role, isActive }` |
| `PUT /users/:id/reset-password` | Admin | `{ newPassword }` |
| `DELETE /users/:id` | Admin | Soft-deactivates; `?hard=true` permanently deletes |
| `GET /exams` | Any | List exams; `?mine=true` filters to the logged-in invigilator; `?status=` filters by status |
| `GET /exams/:id` | Any | Single exam |
| `POST /exams` | Admin | Create exam |
| `PUT /exams/:id` | Admin | Update exam |
| `DELETE /exams/:id` | Admin | Delete exam |
| `GET /students/lookup/:studentId` | Any | Simulated University API — the scan/search endpoint |
| `GET /students` | Admin | List all cached students |
| `POST /students` | Admin | Create/cache a student record |
| `PUT /students/:id` | Admin | Update student record |
| `DELETE /students/:id` | Admin | Delete student record |
| `POST /attendance` | Any | `{ studentId, examId }` → records attendance (online path) |
| `POST /attendance/sync` | Any | `{ records: [{studentId, examId, timeStamp}] }` → bulk offline sync |
| `GET /attendance/exam/:examId` | Any | All attendance records for one exam |
| `GET /attendance` | Admin | All records; filters: `?exam=`, `?eligibilityStatus=`, `?syncStatus=` |
| `GET /reports/overview` | Admin | `{ totalExams, totalRecords, totalPresent, totalNotEligible, totalPending }` |
| `GET /reports/by-department` | Admin | Aggregated eligible/not-eligible counts grouped by faculty+department |

All responses follow `{ success: boolean, data?, message?, count? }`. Errors
are funneled through `middleware/errorHandler.js`, which normalizes Mongoose
`ValidationError`, `CastError`, and duplicate-key (`11000`) errors into clean
JSON with an appropriate HTTP status.

## 9. Seed data (`backend/seedData.js`)

Running `npm run seed` from `backend/` **wipes** the Users, Students, Exams,
AttendanceRecord, and SyncLog collections and recreates:

- 2 Admin accounts, 3 Invigilator accounts (usernames/emails/plain-text
  passwords are printed to the console at the end of the script — passwords
  are never recoverable from the DB once hashed, so this console output is
  the reference copy)
- 10 students across Computer Science, Business, and Engineering
  faculties/departments, with a mix of `Cleared`/`Not Cleared` fee statuses
- 4 examinations in different states (`ongoing`, `scheduled`, `completed`)
  assigned to different invigilators
- 6 sample AttendanceRecord entries covering all three states the UI needs to
  demonstrate: `Eligible`, `Not Eligible` (fee not cleared), and `Pending`
  sync — so dashboards, the Scan screen, and Reports are populated
  immediately without any manual data entry.

Default credentials (also printed by the script):

```
Admin         admin1       admin1@university.edu       Admin@123
Admin         admin2       admin2@university.edu       Admin@123
Invigilator   invig1       invig1@university.edu       Invigilator@123
Invigilator   invig2       invig2@university.edu       Invigilator@123
Invigilator   invig3       invig3@university.edu       Invigilator@123
```

## 10. Environment variables

**backend/.env**
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/exam_attendance_db
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_a_long_random_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=8h
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**frontend/.env**
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## 11. Known simplifications (be aware of these if extending)

- The "University API" is simulated by the local `Student` collection rather
  than a real external HTTPS integration — `studentController.lookupStudent`
  is the seam where a real API call would be substituted.
- ID card scanning (barcode/QR/NFC) is represented by a text input field the
  invigilator types or a hardware scanner "types into" (most USB/Bluetooth ID
  scanners emit keystrokes) — there is no camera-based barcode decoding
  implemented client-side.
- The offline queue lives in `localStorage`, which is per-browser/per-device
  — sufficient for the documented "single invigilator device" scenario, but
  not a substitute for IndexedDB if very large offline batches are expected.
- File exports are CSV only (client-generated); PDF export mentioned in the
  original UI spec is not yet implemented.
- There is no automated test suite in this codebase yet.

## 12. How to extend this system correctly

- Always add new eligibility rules inside
  `attendanceController.checkEligibility` — both the online and offline sync
  paths call this one function, so rules never drift out of sync between the
  two flows.
- Any new protected route must chain `protect` then, if role-restricted,
  `authorize(...)` — see any file in `backend/src/routes/` for the pattern.
- New Mongoose models should follow the existing file layout: schema +
  `timestamps: true` + export via `module.exports = mongoose.model(...)`.
- New frontend pages should be added both to `App.jsx`'s route table and, if
  they need sidebar/mobile-nav entries, to `layouts/AppLayout.jsx`.
- Preserve the `{ success, data, message }` response envelope on every new
  API endpoint so the frontend's existing error-handling patterns keep
  working without special-casing.

## 13. Attendance scanning: OCR (primary) and legacy QR/barcode

The primary scanning method on `pages/ScanAttendance.jsx` is now **camera OCR
of the printed Student ID** on a physical Hormuud University ID card (e.g.
`HU00004698`), not QR/barcode decoding. Both methods end at the exact same
backend call, so eligibility/duplicate/authorization logic never forked:

```
Camera -> OCR recognition -> Student ID extraction/validation -> POST /api/qr/scan -> server-side eligibility -> DB -> result
```

- **`POST /api/qr/scan`** (invigilator only, unchanged) accepts either
  `{ qrData, examId }` or, just as validly, `{ studentId, examId }` directly
  — `qrController.scanStudentQr` calls `extractStudentId(req.body.qrData ||
  req.body.studentId)` (`backend/src/utils/qrPayload.js`). This is why the
  OCR path required **zero backend changes**: it POSTs the recognized
  Student ID straight into the same field manual entry already used. With
  `examId` it resolves the ID → student, checks the invigilator is assigned
  to the exam, and records attendance via
  `services/attendanceService.processAttendanceAttempt` (the same function
  used by manual entry and `/attendance/sync`). Without `examId` it is the
  legacy verify-only call. Responses: 200 + `attendanceStatus: 'Eligible' |
  'Not Eligible'` (both are recorded), 409 duplicate, 403 not assigned,
  404 unknown student, 400 invalid payload.
- **Student ID format** (used by both OCR and QR/manual parsing): 2-4
  uppercase letters then 3-8 digits, e.g. `HU2001`, `HU00004698` — defined
  once in `frontend/src/utils/studentIdParser.js` (`STUDENT_ID_PATTERN`),
  which `frontend/src/utils/parseStudentId.js` imports from so the two
  parsers can never drift onto different formats. The backend's own copy is
  `backend/src/utils/qrPayload.js` (`STUDENT_ID_PATTERN`) — keep these two in
  sync if the format ever changes.
- **OCR flow** (`frontend/src/components/OcrAttendanceScanner.jsx`,
  `OcrCameraView.jsx`, `services/ocrRecognitionService.js`,
  `services/ocrCameraSession.js`, `utils/studentIdParser.js`,
  `utils/imagePreprocess.js`): the camera (rear-facing by default) auto-
  captures the guide-frame region roughly every 1.8s, plus a manual "Capture
  / Recognize now" button; each capture is cropped/grayscaled/thresholded
  (`imagePreprocess.captureIdRegion`), run through a local Tesseract.js
  worker (`ocrRecognitionService.recognizeImage` — recognition itself always
  runs in-browser; no card image is sent to an external OCR service), then
  parsed by `studentIdParser.parseOcrText`. A single high-confidence match is
  submitted automatically (debounced via `scanCoordinator`, same lock the
  legacy QR flow uses, so a card sitting in frame across several auto-capture
  ticks is never submitted twice); a low-confidence or ambiguous (multiple
  plausible IDs) result instead shows an editable confirmation step — the
  invigilator confirms or corrects the ID before anything is submitted. A
  recognized ID is always just a lookup key: the server still does every
  eligibility/duplicate/authorization check from scratch.
- **Legacy QR/barcode** (`components/QrAttendanceScanner.jsx`,
  `components/QrScanner.jsx`, `services/cameraSession.js`,
  `services/scanCoordinator.js`) is no longer wired into
  `ScanAttendance.jsx` but is kept in the codebase, tested, and fully
  functional — any ID card still carrying an old QR/barcode code (or a
  legacy opaque `{"type":"student_verification","token":"..."}` payload,
  still parsed by `qrPayload.js`'s `extractQrToken` for previously-queued
  offline scans) keeps working if re-wired into a screen.
- Offline scans (OCR or legacy QR) are queued by `studentId` (+ `examId` +
  `clientId`) in the existing localStorage queue (`services/offlineQueue.js`)
  and revalidated server-side by `/attendance/sync` — eligibility is never
  trusted from the client, online or offline.
- `components/AttendanceResultCard.jsx` is the shared result UI for both
  scanning flows (green/red/amber + icon + text, never color alone).
- Tests: `npm test` in `backend/` and `frontend/` (Node's built-in test
  runner). `frontend/test/studentIdParser.test.js` covers OCR extraction/
  correction; `frontend/test/scanner.test.js` covers the legacy QR path.
